What is Viewfinder? It's a HTML user-interface for a browser that runs on a remote server. This means you can embed a browser UI on your website and provide unrestricted access to web resources in a way that's both more sandboxed than, and less restricted than, traditional web `<iframe>` elements. In also enables the building of a number of interesting [applications](#applications).

## Pro or Regular? 

What's the difference between VF Pro and regular VF? The main differences are that VF Pro has more advanced features and more frequent updates than VF regular. Many Pro features eventually are sent down to regular, but some will likely remain exclusive to Pro. Pro is updated weekly, with major updates shipped every quarter, whereas regular VF follows a much slower and more haphazard release cycle. 

The final main differenece you might want to be aware of is that while VF regular is source-available (and is the sourcecode in this repository), VF Pro is currently closed-source proprietary software only available commercially, for either use in an Individual server, or for deployment in a Self-hosted package. 

More information on these [commercial options](#commercial-options) is below.

*Cute product comparison markdown table - coming soon!*

## Commercial Options

Viewfinder Pro is provided by the [Dosyago Corporation](https://github.com/dosyago) as a commercial offering in two flavors: individual, and self-hosted.

**Self-hosted**

Includes the provision of software, license and various tiers of service. Basic cost principle is based on time (not scale): time you want the license for, time of the latest update you want, and time it takes us to service your deployment. Targeted at SMBs up to Enterprise. 

- Various configurable packages available with either perpetual or yearly licensing, and included service and consulting. 
- Starts at USD6,700 a year for non-perpetual single year license plus minimal service. 
- Mid-tier options cost 10K - 16K yearly with a variety of options including perpetual or annual licenses.
- Invoiceable service and consulting also available.
- BYO cloud or data-center, or on-prem are all available.

Prices and buy links for Self-hosted tiers are *coming soon!* In the meantime, <a href="mailto:cris@dosycorp.com?subject=VF%20Pro%20Packages&body=Hi%20Cris" target=_blank>email me</a> to ask a question.

**Individual**

Includes provision of a geographically located server wherever you want (or as close to it as possible for us), installed software, credentials to access, and various tiers of service. Basic cost principle is based on performance (CPU cores, memory, network speed and bandwidth amount). 

See the current [prices and tiers](https://personal.dosyago.com) for the Individual track. 

## Applications

Some possible applications to build with Viewfinder:

**Product space**
- Remote browser isolation for security, risk mitigation and privacy
- Zero download co-browsing for collaboration and social interaction
- Delivery layer for a zero download web scraping app that works on any device format
- Alternate browser extension platform with associated app store
- An online "internet cafe" with advanced security and privacy features
- An alternative to VPNs, DNS blocklists
- Email attachment threat mitigation via CDR and automatic opening of links and attachments in the remote browser
- An intuitive UI affordance to enable clients to stay in-app while performing 3rd-party processes that normally require them to leave your web site.
- A fully skinable and themeable client-customizable online hosted web browser alternative to downloadable browsers

**Internal tooling space**
- Human-in-the-loop intervention tool to unblock stuck browser automation jobs, and diagnose "selector drift" and script-page mismatch issues
- An effective web proxy to easily integrate 3rd-party processes without APIs
- An effective, interactive console to inspect, observe and interact with browser automation tasks
- An automatable browser that more effectively evades bot detection mechanisms that pure headless Chrome
- A scriptable console, and interactive simulator for automation tasks and automation script creation with a great, familiar and intuitive feedback loop

**Tech and framework space**
- A `<WebView>` tag for the open web
- An `<iframe>` without cross-origin restrictions 
- A 'head' for headless browsers

## Motivation

I originally created this in 2018 as a layer for a collaborative zero-download clientless web-scraping app I'm working on, but fell in love with this browser layer, and decided it was useful enough and a product category in its own right.
